# Welcome to My GitHub Profile
I'm a seasoned software engineer specializing in cybersecurity, where I bridge the gap between high-level application development and low-level systems programming. With extensive experience in designing secure, custom solutions, I bring a hybrid approach that leverages both senior-level strategic insights and hands-on low-level coding expertise.


### About Me
Currently, Iâ€™m working at an undisclosed company, contributing to innovative projects that prioritize security and efficiency. In addition, I'm actively engaged in two distinct initiatives:
- :oncoming_police_car: **Law Enforcement & Cybercrime Blog:** Providing timely insights and analysis on cybersecurity and digital crime. [Visit website.](https://brokenscope.com)
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Marketing Insights Solution:** Developing a data-driven platform to empower businesses with strategic marketing intelligence.
